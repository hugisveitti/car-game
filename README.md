# car-game

I am trying to write a car game where you use your phone to steer a car which is displayed in the browser of your computer.

### Libraries 

Written in nodejs backend and the threejs library for graphics. I am learning all of this as I do it so it may be shitty.

I first made the game https://box-fly.herokuapp.com/ in one day and the idea of this game is built on that game.
